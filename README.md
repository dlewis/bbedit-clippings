BBEdit Clippings
================

A set of clippings for use with [BBEdit](http://barebones.com/products/bbedit).

Installation
------------
Place them into ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Clippings/

As of BBEdit 9.5, a fresh install of BBEdit will no longer populate the ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit folder;
instead it will simply create empty placeholder folders.

Clippings
---------

### Universal Items
A useful tip is to assign them to shortcut keys eg CTRL + CMD + ' for Wrap in Single Quotes will then create a pair of quotes 
with the cursor in between (simulating the default behaviour of some other text editors which auto pair quotes).
You can also highlight text and use these shortcuts to wrap the text in braces, quotes etc.
