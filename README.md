BBEdit Clippings
================

A set of clippings for use with [BBEdit](http://barebones.com/products/bbedit).

Installation
------------
Place them into ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Clippings/

As of BBEdit 9.5, a fresh install of BBEdit will no longer populate the ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit folder;
instead it will simply create empty placeholder folders.
